Browser host-window, keyboard, pointer, and cursor adapters for CarbonEngineJS.

Use this package to translate DOM window and input events into Carbon-shaped
main-window callbacks and state. It can also run headlessly with injected
host objects. Gamepad, touch gestures, spacemouse, IME composition, and WebXR
input are not implemented by the current package.

## Install

```sh
npm install @carbonenginejs/runtime-input
```

## Quick start

```js
import { Tr2MainWindow } from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-input";

const mainWindow = new Tr2MainWindow({
    window,
    document,
    target: document.documentElement
});

mainWindow.onKeyDown = (scancode, repeated, event) => {
    console.log(scancode, repeated, event.code);
};

mainWindow.onMouseMove = (x, y, dx, dy) => {
    console.log({ x, y, dx, dy });
};
```

Call `Detach()` when the host no longer owns the listeners:

```js
mainWindow.Detach();
```
